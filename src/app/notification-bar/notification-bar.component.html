            <li>
              As used herein, “<b>Confidential Information</b>” means any
              information that one Party (the “<b>Disclosing Party</b>”)
              provides to the other Party (the “<b>Receiving Party</b>”) in
              connection with this Agreement, whether orally or in writing, that
              is designated as confidential or that reasonably should be
              considered to be confidential given the nature of the information
              and/or the circumstances of disclosure. For clarity, the Mapsol IP
              will be deemed Confidential Information of Mapsol. However,
              Confidential Information will not include any information or
              materials that: (i) were, at the date of disclosure, or have
              subsequently become, generally known or available to the public
              through no act or failure to act by the Receiving Party; (ii) were
              rightfully known by the Receiving Party prior to receiving such
              information or materials from the Disclosing Party; (iii) are
              rightfully acquired by the Receiving Party from a third party who
              has the right to disclose such information or materials without
              breach of any confidentiality or non-use obligation to the
              Disclosing Party; or (iv) are independently developed by or for
              the Receiving Party without use of or access to any Confidential
              Information of the Disclosing Party.
            </li>
            <li>
              The Receiving Party will maintain the Disclosing Party’s
              Confidential Information in strict confidence, and will not use
              the Confidential Information of the Disclosing Party except as
              necessary to perform its obligations or exercise its rights under
              this Agreement; <i>provided</i> that Mapsol may use and modify
              your Confidential Information in deidentified form for purposes of
              developing and deriving Platform Data. The Receiving Party will

              of the Disclosing Party, except (i) to those employees,
              representatives, or contractors of the Receiving Party who have a

              use and nondisclosure restrictions at least as protective as those
              set forth in this Agreement, or (ii) as such disclosure may be
              required by the order or requirement of a court, administrative
              agency or other governmental body, subject to the Receiving Party
              providing to the Disclosing Party reasonable written notice to

              the Receiving Party; <i>provided</i>, however, with respect to any
              Confidential Information that constitutes a trade secret (as
              determined under applicable law), such obligations of
              non-disclosure will survive the termination or expiration of this
